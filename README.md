# C++

Learning the language C++.

## Intro

Create a file with the extension `.cpp` and write the following lines of code:

```c++
  #include <iostream>

  using namespace std;

  int main() {
    char name[32];

    cout<<"Your name: ";
    cin>>name;

    cout<<"âœ¨ Hi "<<name<<"!\n";

    return 0;
  }

```

Then run the application with [gcc and Make](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/cpp/gcc_make.html), but feel free to use other tools as you like.

Congratulations! :tada: :tada: has written your first lines of code in __c++__. Maybe you still do not understand the instructions of the program well, but little by little it will discover a language to communicate with computers. lets' start! :rocket:
